Register App is a simple React Native app.
It was created to learn React Native combined with Typescript and to test communication between the app and a local server.
It allows user to create an account and see list of all users fetched from server.
Then you can check detailed information of each and every user from the list and delete user of your choice.
Server used for testing has its own, seperate repository named 'register-app-server'.
In order to test it, you need to change server ip address and  server port in Config/app-config.js.
